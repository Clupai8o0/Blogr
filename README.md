## My process
Originally I started with making the complete website in desktop view without giving a second thought
to making it more responsive and I suffered for it
The best way to do it would've been to
- Make a basic HTML containers
- Work on one element at a time making it responsive at that moment itself rather then leavin it for later
- Keep repeating this until I made it to the final
- Add js for some functionality and done

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://tachyons.io/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Make custom CSS for speed and efficiency
- Make it responsive right away
